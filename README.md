## Getting Started

1. `git clone git@github.com:agamm/pseo-next.git pseo-example`
2. `npm i`
3. Start docker (for local postgress DB)
4. Open `https://localhost:3000/`
5. Check the `Development section`.

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development

- .env.example -> mv to -> .env (change parameters if needed)
- /src/app/(site) - all of your landing pages go here (Home page, about, terms etc...)
- /posts - Your blog written as Markdown files.
- /src/app/blog - change your blog layout.
- /src/variant/[slug] - This is where you do your Programmatic variants.

  - Would be something like: yoursite.com/hotels/spain-summer-2023 (variant="hotels", slug="spain-summer-2023")
  - Remember to uncomment the comments there to actually fetch from your DB.

- Make sure to look into /src/components (I recommend using <TryImage> everywhere)

Lastly after fixing all of the `FIXME` comments. Connect your project to Prisma by:

- Adding your schema in /prisma/schema.prisma
- `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`
- `npm run db`

## Deployment

1. Connect your repository to Vercel.
2. Add your env variables to Vercel.
3. In vercel change the build:
   `npm run prod:build`
